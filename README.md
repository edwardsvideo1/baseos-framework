# baseos
Pre-Prod BaseOS for MaaS-like initiatives.

## Requirements
-  Flatcar Operating System - Immutable - Ephemeral - Stateless
-  UEFI Support
-  TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Support
-  Intel TXT (Trusted Execution Technology) Support
-  SLAAC IPv6 for Data Interfaces
-  No PXE
-  No DHCP

## Goals
-  Build a lightweight image that requires minimal environmental configuration to load quickly and do discovery and inventory tasks.
-  Enable a framework for container workloads to be layered in over time, to possibly include cabling checks, hardware checks, health checks, firmware updates, etc.
-  Enable base shell of an OS that can be accessible on the network with minimal configuration.
-  Create simple chainload-like bootstrap design flexible enough to handle an environment that is in infant stages of configuration or has been fully configured for production.

## Findings
Flatcar doesn't support UEFI by default.  Today in Production, this is achieved by using iPXE as a bootloader, which bypasses limitations of flatcar's EFI support.
- NoGo - If using the Virtual CDROM approach via Out-of-Band (OOB) for the full image install, UEFI isn't supported by default.  CoPilot + Claude was used to help achieve this goal and I was never able to get it to work with TPM Enabled.
- NoGo - If using UEFI HTTP Boot with grubx64.efi method of loading kernel + initrd, TPM enabled looks to limit the memory for Flatcar's kernel.  Disabling TPM eliminates this error:

- NoGo - If using UEFI HTTP Boot with ipxe.efi method of loading kernel + initrd, SLAAC does assign the IPv6 addresses, but since there's no way to configure the MTU in UEFI HTTP Boot mode, the ipxe.efi file download fails.  Production router configs require MTU of 9100 and it appears UEFI Firmware is defaulting to 1500 with no easy way to override.
- Go - If using a customized ipxe.iso (about 2MB) mounted via Virtual CDROM, SLAAC, TPM, Intel TXT, UEFI are all supported and Flatcar proceeds without any customized image tweaks.
